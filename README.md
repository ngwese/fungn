quad cv function generator

a simple utility inspired by many prior works in hardware and software

## notes

output of each function is displayed on corresponding arc ring

choose arc or cv as the input for a function, select the encoder or
channel as desired. functions can share inputs

choose a cv channel for output. deselecting cv mutes the function
output and holds the last value.

enabling ± on a cv input maps bipolar cv to unipolar function input

enabling ± on a cv output maps unipolar function output to bipolar cv
output

ten presets of all four function curves can be saved and loaded. morph
interpolates between presets either manually via the dial or via
unipolar cv input

the left and right ƒ controls define the cv input polling interval for
the function inputs and morph input respectively
